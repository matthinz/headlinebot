## TODO

- [ ] Save article data between each step (so we do less work next time)
- [ ] Refactor selectors / scrapers out a bit
- [ ] Store raw HTML w/ article, parse that directly (rather than using browser)
- [ ] Better paywall feedback
- [ ] Better logging of ChatGPT usage
- [ ] Token limit
- [ ] Non-headless chrome that is minimally invasive:
  - [`--no-startup-window`](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#no-startup-window)
